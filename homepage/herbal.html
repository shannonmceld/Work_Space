           <p>I am someone who uses plants for healing purposes. </p>
           <p>I am dedicated to promoting health and well-being of people and the planet through plant medicine. </p>
           <p>I practice yoga and make different things from all natural ingredients. Itâ€™s not a business or a job. I enjoy what nature offers us and use it in my everyday life and sometime even help others.
                   One thing I enjoy is making my organic herbal teas. I have so many recipes for so many reasons such as: detoxing, sleeping, dieting, energy, and much more.
                   I am the happiest when I am solving a problem, researching Herbs, or singing to the trees and flowers. These lessons were taught to myself on my journey, finding my true purpose.
                   I taught myself all about flower varieties, tree lore, soil & water conditions, and to "NEVER put a shovel in that ground without checking the internet first Ha! Ha!!".
                   One of my fondest memories of my journey was going to Bridge Street, an outlet mall here in Huntsville that has many major stores such as Barnes and Nobles.
                   next to this Barness and Nobles is Cheesecake Factory, I was headed there to get me one of their sweetest New York style cheesecake and as I was walking by I spotted and Herbal medicine book on sale for 15 bucks.
                   To my surprise I stopped and decided to open the book and was blessed with all this information, some I practice still to this day.
                   Spending hours in the Garden, covered in dirt, and making natural products seems to bring me back to the meaning of life. One thing I will teach my daughter and hopefully she extends the information if possible.
